# NI VeriStand Custom Device Testing Tools

The **niveristand-custom-device-testing-tools** repository provides a common set of tools to automate testing NI VeriStand custom devices, including both unit and system tests. The intended audience includes custom device developers and integrators.

To get started with testing a custom device, create a VI Tester test case which derives from `VeriStandTestCase`. Example test cases will be available in supported custom devices in the future.
